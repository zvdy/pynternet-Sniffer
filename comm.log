feat: Dynamically create log file name with timestamp

- Updated the log file name to include a timestamp, making it dynamically generated as `network_activity_<timestamp>.log`.
- Added the [`datetime`] module to generate the current timestamp.
- Modified the [`logging.basicConfig`] to use the dynamically generated log file name.
